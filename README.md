# unit10-full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1
 
This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a mock school database containing information about courses. Users can retrieve a list of courses, view details on a specific course, create/update/delete courses. Users can only update and delete courses they are owners of, but any signed-in user can create a course.
